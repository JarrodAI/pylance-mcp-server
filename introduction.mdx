## What is Pylance MCP Pro?

Pylance MCP Pro is a professional, production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the full power of Microsoft's Pylance/Pyright language server to AI coding assistants with advanced features like OpenTelemetry tracing and conversation logging. It enables Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue.dev, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible clients to autonomously analyze, refactor, type-check, and fix entire Python codebases with zero human intervention.

## Features

### 🧠 IntelliSense Completions
Full LSP completion support with type inference. Get context-aware suggestions with function signatures, parameter hints, and docstrings—exactly like VS Code.

### ⚡ Instant Type Checking
Pyright-powered static analysis catches type errors, undefined variables, and import issues before runtime. Zero-config diagnostics for the entire workspace.

### 🎯 Go-to-Definition
Jump to function, class, or variable definitions across files, packages, and virtual environments. Works with stdlib, third-party libs, and your code.

### 🔍 Find All References
Locate every usage of a symbol across your entire codebase in milliseconds. Perfect for refactoring or understanding data flow in complex projects.

### 💡 Hover Type Info
Inspect type annotations, function signatures, and docstrings on-demand. See inferred types, parameter info, and return types without leaving your flow.

### 🔄 Safe Symbol Renaming
Rename variables, functions, or classes across multiple files with guaranteed correctness. LSP ensures all references are updated atomically.

### ✨ Auto-Format & Fix
Format Python code with Black/autopep8 integration. Apply quick fixes for imports, type hints, and common issues with a single command.

### 🗂️ Workspace Intelligence
Multi-file edits, bulk refactoring, and project-wide operations. Create, modify, or delete files programmatically via LSP workspace edits.

### 🐍 Venv Auto-Detection
Automatically discovers Python interpreters, virtual environments, and package dependencies. Supports conda, venv, poetry, and system Python.

### 🔬 Deep Code Analysis
Advanced diagnostics beyond syntax: unused imports, unreachable code, type narrowing issues, and missing type stubs. Powered by Pyright's type checker.

### 🌐 MCP Protocol Native
Built on Model Context Protocol—works seamlessly with Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue.dev, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client.

### 📊 Training Data Export
Optional logging of all prompts, responses, and tool calls to SQLite. Export to JSONL for fine-tuning your own models on real Python workflows.
