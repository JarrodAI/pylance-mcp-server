## How Authentication Works

When you use Pylance MCP, secure authentication happens automatically in the background.

### What Gets Protected

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Your Workspace" icon="folder">
    Only you can access your Python projects and code
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your Requests" icon="lock">
    Each API call is authenticated and encrypted
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your Data" icon="shield">
    Code analysis happens securely - nothing is shared
  </Card>
  <Card title="Your API Keys" icon="key">
    Keys are hashed and never stored in plain text
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Automatic Security Features

Every request is protected:
- ✅ Encrypted connections (TLS 1.3)
- ✅ Secure token validation
- ✅ Automatic session expiry
- ✅ Rate limit protection
- ✅ Workspace isolation

## Authorization

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Permissions | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Free** | 100 requests/day | Personal projects |
| **Hobby** | 5,000 requests/day | Side projects |
| **Pro** | 50,000 requests/day | Professional development |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | Large teams |

### Workspace Isolation

Each user's workspace is isolated:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="File System Sandboxing">
    Users can only access files within their workspace directory. No parent directory traversal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Process Isolation">
    Pylance runs in a separate process per user with resource limits (CPU, memory).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Network Restrictions">
    No outbound network access from analysis processes. Only MCP server can make external calls.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data Security

### Encryption

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="In Transit" icon="shield-halved">
    All connections use TLS 1.3. No unencrypted traffic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="At Rest" icon="database">
    PostgreSQL uses AES-256 encryption for stored data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Variables" icon="key">
    Secrets stored in Railway/Fly.io encrypted vaults.
  </Card>
  <Card title="API Keys" icon="lock">
    Hashed with bcrypt before database storage.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Data Retention

| Data Type | Retention | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| User code | Session only | Analysis, not stored |
| Request logs | 30 days | Debugging, auditing |
| Usage metrics | 90 days | Billing, analytics |
| Error reports | 7 days | Issue resolution |

<Info>
  **Your code never leaves your machine** when using local deployment. Cloud deployment analyzes code in memory only.
</Info>

## Rate Limiting

Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage:

```python
# Rate limits by subscription tier
FREE_TIER = {
    "requests_per_day": 100,
    "requests_per_hour": 20,
    "concurrent_requests": 2
}

HOBBY_TIER = {
    "requests_per_day": 5000,
    "requests_per_hour": 500,
    "concurrent_requests": 5
}

PRO_TIER = {
    "requests_per_day": 50000,
    "requests_per_hour": 5000,
    "concurrent_requests": 20
}
```

### Rate Limit Headers

Responses include rate limit information:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4987
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1703001600
```

## Vulnerability Management

### Security Updates

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automated Dependency Scanning">
    Dependabot monitors for CVEs in dependencies
  </Step>
  <Step title="Weekly Security Audits">
    `npm audit` and `pip-audit` run in CI/CD
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rapid Patching">
    Critical vulnerabilities patched within 24 hours
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notification">
    Users notified via email for breaking changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Responsible Disclosure

## Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

<Check>Right to Access: Download your data via API</Check>
<Check>Right to Erasure: Delete account removes all data</Check>
<Check>Data Portability: Export in JSON format</Check>
<Check>Privacy by Design: Minimal data collection</Check>

### SOC 2 Type II

Enterprise plan includes SOC 2 Type II compliance:
- Annual third-party audits
- Security controls documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Access logs and monitoring

## Best Practices for Users

### Protecting Your API Keys

<Warning>
  Never share your API keys or commit them to version control.
</Warning>

```bash
# ✅ Store keys securely in your environment
export PYLANCE_MCP_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# ✅ Use your IDE's secure credential storage
# Each IDE guide shows how to configure this safely
```

### Using the Service Securely
